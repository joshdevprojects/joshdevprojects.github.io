Dr Hajek's style is direct and therapy felt quite challenging at times, but we found it beneficial for our progress. Our communication has improved greatly due to the therapy and we would definitely recommend Dr Hajek as we felt it was money well spent.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Gina and Jason</p></div><img src="/_nuxt/img/1346927.jpg" class="review-image review-image-two" data-v-ee5a9998></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><img src="/_nuxt/img/b92d050.jpg" class="review-image review-image-two" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-right" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>We are not a married couple (yet). We were at a challenging time that had become more difficult through poor communication. Dr Hajek not only listened but challenged us to listen to each other. The sessions were well balanced and we were given a chance to reflect on previous sessions to ensure both of us were benefitting. We needed a neutral party to help us through the challenges.We came with one main issue and left with skills to deal with so many different situations. We are grateful to Dr Hajek and feel so much more prepared for our married life together.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Cara and David</p></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-left" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>I can't recommend Dr Hajek enough. I was looking for someone who would listen, understand and challenge me to make strong, positive choices within a particularly challenging time of my life and she has given me just that, helping me see things in a different way. Thanks for all your help!</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- John</p></div><img src="/_nuxt/img/df54e43.jpg" class="review-image review-image-two" data-v-ee5a9998></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="lead-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-fullwidth" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="text-container" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>Over the course of my  therapy with Katja I have began to build an awareness of my habitual thought patterns and assumptions. Katja’s direct and honest communication has made me feel like I have a guide and an ally through this challenging time in my life. She is not afraid to challenge my assumptions and there is a feeling of accountability that is incredibly helpful to me. I often feel very overwhelmed and my thoughts can be quite muddled, and Katja has never made me feel like I have overwhelmed her. I feel I have more control over my thoughts and feelings now, and it is helping me to build self esteem. Thank you Katja</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Hanna</p></div></div></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><img src="/_nuxt/img/e93a7e7.jpg" class="review-image review-image-one" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-right" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>Katja was a wonderful source of calm insight and balanced views. She helped me at a time in my marriage where our ability to communicate had broken down and I no-longer felt heard. Without judgement, Katja listened to us both and through a series of well planned sessions moved us forward.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Helen and Carl</p></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="lead-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-fullwidth" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="text-container" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>We found the couple sessions very useful . Katja was professional and she was able to put us at ease. She helped us to explore the causes of some difficult issues and communication problems, and was able to suggest more helpful behaviours to both of us. Having time set aside to really listen, and try to understand each other better with the help of a skilled therapist was invaluable in helping us improve our relationship.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Rosie and James</p></div></div></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-left" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>I would highly recommend Dr Katja Hajek. She is very thorough and practical. She helped me work through some long standing issues, gain much needed perspective in some areas and helped me to be more accepting of things I cannot change. I have new confidence and skills to move forward in life. I really benefit from the therapy. Thank you Katja!!!</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Mary</p></div><img src="/_nuxt/img/b79cb6d.jpg" class="review-image review-image-three" data-v-ee5a9998></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="lead-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-fullwidth" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="text-container" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>When I first began attending therapy I considered myself to be fairly 'self aware' and having struggled with depression, negative thoughts and anxiety for many years I was very sceptical as to what I would get out of it or how things could change. I thought that this was just ‘how life was’. However Katja’s insightful comments and constructive challenge made me realise there were a lot of areas where I was making unhelpful assumptions and being unnecessarily pessimistic. Her approach is very structured with clear aims, regular reviews and check ins as to how you feel things are progressing which gave me assurance that we were both working towards the same outcome and I knew why she was asking me things that were sometimes difficult to discuss. By making a conscious effort to put the work in, reflect on our therapy discussions and apply them to everyday life, I now feel so much better in a way that I really had not thought possible before. I’m very grateful to her for bringing a different perspective to how I view things and make sure that when I catch that nasty voice in my head I remind myself of one of her particularly useful comments; just because it was that way before, doesn’t mean it has to be now.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Anna</p></div></div></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><img src="/_nuxt/img/e0a948e.jpeg" class="review-image review-image-four" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-right" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>I met Katja in October 2018. On the way to meeting her for the first time, I felt uncertain, uneasy, not sure about what to expect. After our first session, I felt relieved and happy about my decision to have involved a stranger, (a psychologist) i.e. a non-related person to me and my problems with my husband.</p><p data-v-ee5a9998>I looked forward to our weekly meeting: they did me a lot of good. Whatever we spoke about, I had found a partner who gave me incentives to think about and suggestions how to possibly react in certain situations. I have also profited from the recommendation of specific literature, which I, still today, turn to and read when needed.</p><p data-v-ee5a9998>But most of all, it was Katja's welcoming and understanding approach to my problems which helped me a lot.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Christine</p></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="lead-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-fullwidth" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="text-container" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>Our relationship had come to a point of crisis when we decided to try couples therapy. We had no idea of where or who to go to, but we wanted a therapist with experience who could help us see a way through. And so, with a little scepticism we started therapy with Katja. From the very first session Katja seemed determined to understand and get to the heart of our problems and to give us a possible way out of our difficulties that didn't involve breaking up our family. Therapy has been painful and difficult at times, but Katja created such a safe space for us, a space of equality and fairness that has allowed us to hear and speak to each other. </p><p data-v-ee5a9998>With her guidance, we have given ourselves a chance to get back to the relationship that we dreamed we would have and a future together that had seemed almost impossible before working with her. Katja's insight and ability as a therapist has been remarkable, and in a very short space of time has changed our behaviour, our relationship and our lives for the better. We would have no hesitation in recommending Katja Hajek to anyone in need of relationship counselling.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Natasha and Ben</p></div></div></div></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-split-left" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>I have found Dr Katja Hajek to be both welcoming and patient. I was new to therapy, so initially found it daunting, and did not know what to expect, but she has given me space to be heard and challenged. She is insightful, a fantastic listener and helps you connect the dots in sessions that are customized to your needs.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Frankie</p></div><img src="/_nuxt/img/36ce0a6.jpg" class="review-image review-image-three" data-v-ee5a9998></div><div class="review-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="lead-container" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="review-fullwidth" data-v-ee5a9998><div class="text-container" data-v-ee5a9998><p data-v-ee5a9998>My partner and I had six sessions with Dr Katja Hajek and she was very supportive. She has a wonderful way of helping you view things from another person’s perspective, and helps you to think about a whole situation and its impact.</p><p data-v-ee5a9998>She gave us exercises after each session which really helped us to focus on our goals. She would also check in with us after a tricky session to make sure we were doing alright. It felt very personal and both my partner and I were very happy we made the choice to speak with Katja.</p><p data-v-ee5a9998>She really helped us break a communication barrier and encouraged us to work on some previously tricky topics.</p><p data-v-ee5a9998>She is very professional and always supportive. We would highly recommend her to anyone who needs to talk to someone about relationships issues, and she will help you work through them.</p><p class="names" data-v-ee5a9998>- Sylvia and John</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-title"><img src="/_nuxt/bd2e44ebac6e705dbafdc35a53a72815.svg"></div><div class="footer-container"><div class="footer-notsure"></div><div class="footer-placecard"><div>Dr Katja Hajek, MA, PhD</div><div>Clinical Psychologist, HCPC Registered</div></div><div class="footer-links"></div><div class="footer-button-container"><a href="/contact" class="footer-button">CONTACT</a></div><div class="associations"><img src="/_nuxt/img/6351f15.jpg" class="hcpc-logo"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellors/katja-hajek"><img src="/_nuxt/img/1c5d0af.png" class="counselling-directory"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__={layout:"default",data:[{}],fetch:[],error:null,serverRendered:!0,routePath:"/testimonials"}</script><script src="/_nuxt/36ea65c5b233a9cb9eae.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/d096fd7d0aff58673793.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/37d31d6c6bc041fa43fe.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/65e48ae5ff40e418db7e.js" defer></script>
